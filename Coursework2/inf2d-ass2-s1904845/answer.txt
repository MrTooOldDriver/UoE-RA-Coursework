Initial state:
Connect(F,E) Connect(E,B) Connect(B,C) Connect(C,D) Connect(B,A) Connect(A,L)
Connect(E,F) Connect(B,E) Connect(C,B) Connect(D,C) Connect(A,B) Connect(L,A)
Minobot(M) BoTheseus(T) Sword(S) Object(S)
At(M,L) At(T,E) At(S,D)



Task 1.2
Action(Move(t,x,y))
precondition: BoTheseus(t), At(t,x), Connect(x,y), 
Effect: ¬At(t,x) At(t,y)

Action(Pickup(t,o))
Precondition: BoTheseus(t), ¬Holding(t,y), Object(o), At(t,x), At(o,x)
Effect: Holding(t,o), ¬At(o,x)

Action(Slay(t, m))
Precondition: BoTheseus(t), Minobot(m), At(m,x), At(t,x), Holding(t,s), Sword(s), Object(s)
Effect: Defeated(m)


Task 1.3
Starting state: 
Connect(B,A), Connect(A,L),
Minobot(M), BoTheseus(T), Sword(S), Object(S),
At(M,L), At(T,B), At(S,A)

Initial goal state:  Defeated(m)

Starting from goal state
Step1
Current goal state: Defeated(m)
Relevant action:
Slay(T,M) - Becuase it is the only action that effect contain Defrated
Choose action: Slay(T,M)
New goal state: BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,L), Holding(T,S), Sword(S), Object(S)

Step2 
Current goal state: BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,L), Holding(T,S), Sword(S), Object(S)
Relevant action:
Move(T,A,L) - Becuase it is the only action that effect contain At(M,L)
Pickup(T,S)  - Becuase it is the only action that effect contain Holding(T,S)
Choose action: Move(T,A,L)
New goal state: BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,A), Holding(T,S), Sword(S), Object(S), Connect(A,L)

Step3
Current goal state: BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,A), Holding(T,S), Sword(S), Object(S), Connect(A,L)
Relevant action:
Move(T,B,A) - Becuase it is the only action that effect contain At(T,B)
Pickup(T,S)  - Becuase it is the only action that effect contain Holding(T,S)
Choose action: Pickup(T,S)
New goal state: BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,A), At(S,A), Sword(S), Object(S), Connect(A,L)

Step4
Current goal state: BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,A), At(S,A), Sword(S), Object(S), Connect(A,L)
Relevant action:
Move - Becuase it is the only action that effect contain At(T,B)
Choose action: Move(T,B,A)
New goal state: BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,B), At(S,A), Sword(S), Object(S), Connect(B,A), Connect(A,L)

Step5
Current goal state: 
BoTheseus(T), Minobot(M), At(M,L), At(T,B), At(S,A), Sword(S), Object(S), Connect(B,A), Connect(A,L)
Statisfied by initial starting state: 
Connect(B,A), Connect(A,L), Minobot(M), BoTheseus(T), Sword(S), Object(S), At(M,L), At(T,B), At(S,A)
Hence terminates.
Plan: Move(T,B,A) -> Pickup(T,S) -> Move(T,A,L) -> Slay(T,M)
